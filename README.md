**LinkedList** is a simple data structure which can be found easily here and there.
But I've found that the introduction of `sentinel` to LinkedList may simplfy the implementation of LinkedList class even if it is not faster.
And the implementaiton in value type would be another alternative: I love **value type** as well.
However, I prefer a clearer, simpler, manageable implementation in Swift5 that is my point. 


### Singly Linked List Example:
 Some related exercise for singly linked list is here:
 https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/discuss/1632426/in-Swift-5.5-clearer-faster-and-more-understandable-code
 This is my implementation, experience of the problem on LeetCode.com
  and I found that most coding competition sites do **NOT** treat elegantly Swift language so far.
